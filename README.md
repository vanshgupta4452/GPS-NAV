## About the Project
This project aims to develop a comprehensive ROS2 simulation package tailored for a differential drive robot.This repository shows how to set up a localization system using a GPS sensor(s) as the source of global positioning, robot_localization (RL) for sensor fusion, and how to use Nav2 to follow GPS waypoints.

### Built With
* [![Ubuntu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-E95420?style=for-the-badge&logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white)](https://ubuntu.com/)
* [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org/)
* [![ROS 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/ros-%230A0FF9.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=ros&logoColor=white)](https://www.sphinx-docs.org)

## Getting started
Follow these instructions to set up this project on your system.

### Prerequisites

* ROS Humble
Refer to the official [ROS 2 installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)
* Gazebo Classic
```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs
```
* Robot_localization and mapviz:
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-robot-localization
sudo apt install ros-humble-mapviz
sudo apt install ros-humble-mapviz-plugins
sudo apt install ros-humble-tile-map
```
* Nav2 packages
```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-navigation2
sudo apt install ros-humble-nav2-bringup
```

### Installation
 
 1. Make a new workspace
    ```bash
    mkdir -p gps_nav_ws/src
    ```

2. Clone the GPS_Nav repository

    Now go ahead and clone this repository inside the "src" folder of the workspace you just created.

      ```bash
      cd gps_nav_ws/src
      git clone git@github.com:atom-robotics-lab/GPS_Nav.git
      ```

3. Compile the package

    Follow this execution to compile your ROS 2 package
  
      ```bash
      colcon build --symlink-install
      ```

4. Source your workspace
      ```bash
      source install/local_setup.bash
      ```

## Usage
Our package consists of three directories as follows:-

- The `mr_robot_description` dir contains all the bot model description files.
- The `mr_robot_gazebo` dir contains all the world description files.
- The `mr_robot_navigation` dir contains all the config files for enabling navigation and planning.

### 1. Launch navigation
Spawns our robot in a custom gazebo world along with all the necessary plugins. It also launches navigation
```bash
ros2 launch mr_robot_navigation gps_waypoint_follower.launch.py use_rviz:=True
```
**_NOTE:_** Make sure that you have installed the navigation dependencies before running the navigation launch file.<br />

### 2. Mapviz
[Docker image for tile map](https://github.com/danielsnider/MapViz-Tile-Map-Google-Maps-Satellite)<br />
* Launches mapviz GUI 
```bash
ros2 launch mr_robot_navigation mapviz.launch.py
```

### 3. Run interactive_waypoint_follower script
This script makes the robot navigate to the clicked waypoint in mapviz
```bash
ros2 run mr_robot_navigation interactive_waypoint_follower
```

### 4. Run gps_waypoint_logger script
Opens up a GUI to save the robot current coordinates and heading on demand to a yaml file 
```bash
ros2 run mr_robot_navigation gps_waypoint_logger
```

### 5. Run logged_waypoint_follower script
Robot navigates through previously logged waypoints
```bash
ros2 run mr_robot_navigation logged_waypoint_follower
```
